    <div class="story">
        <p>
            Anne Harris has made a career traveling the world as a fiddle player. She’s performed with artists like
            Otis Taylor and Jefferson Starship, made an appearance on NPR’s Tiny Desk, and released six albums—all
            while playing the same violin her parents bought her when she was ten years old. “My parents bought me
            the fiddle that I still play today. It’s a 1961 Roth violin,” Anne says. “I came to a point a couple of
            years ago where I decided I needed a new violin to expand my sound.” As a believer that the right things
            find their way to us, Anne leaned into the idea that the violin meant for her would make its way to her.
            Soon enough, Anne stumbled across the Instagram account of a violin maker and instantly knew she had
            found the perfect person for the job. Anne’s Instagram algorithm brought her to Amanda Ewing’s profile,
            the first and only female African American violin maker on record in the United States. As a Black
            fiddle player, Anne was excited to see someone who looked like herself crafting the instrument she
            played. “As soon as I saw Amanda, I immediately knew that she had to make my next instrument,” Anne
            shares.
            Amanda is a luthier—a professional maker of wood stringed instruments. Specifically, she is a maker of
            violins, cellos, and basses. She found her way to the craft when she was laid off from her job of 16
            years.
            <br><br><br>
            “I’m a recovering corporate worker in pursuit of my most extraordinary life,” Amanda shares. “After I
            was laid off, I started saying yes to all the things I love, and that brought me back to playing the
            violin.”
            <br><br><br>
            With the help of a local Nashville violin program, Amanda was introduced to her luthier teacher, who she
            apprenticed under for over four years. While working in the shop one day, Amanda and her teacher talked
            about how few Black violin makers there are. To date, there are still no other known Black female violin
            makers. This inspired Amanda to not only finish her apprenticeship, but to influence the future of
            lutherie by becoming a face in the industry that other young Black and brown girls could relate to.
            “The reason we don’t have any makers that look like me is because there’s no representation,” Amanda
            shares. “Over time, this journey of making violins became more meaningful and less about me. At the
            beginning, it was my joy. But I would also like for it to be someone else’s joy someday.”
            <br><br><br>
            With four years of apprenticeship under her belt, Amanda is now a trained luthier, crafting violins of
            her very own. Anne and Amanda both felt that finding each other was destined. As a Black female fiddle
            player and the only known Black female luthier in the US, they knew they simply had to create a violin
            together.
            <br><br><br>
            “The joy that I had in seeing somebody that could be my sister embracing this art form—the fact that a
            Black woman could make me an instrument,” Anne says, “there was just this sense of ancestral
            intervention. I felt our ancestors rejoicing as they cheered us on in this historical union.”
